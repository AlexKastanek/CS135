# CS135
Course: Intro To Computer Science I

This course was taken in the fall of my Freshman year (Fall 2015).

It covered fundamental programming concepts such as if statements, while loops, multi-dimensional arrays, bitwise operations, etc.
The language the course taught was C. This was to form a fundamental understanding of how programming languages worked before moving on to higher level programming.

This repository contains 100% my code and my methods in solving the problems given to us.
